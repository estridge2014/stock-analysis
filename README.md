# stock-analysis

## Overview: 

In this challenge, I will expand the dataset to include data for the entire stock market over the last few years. The code I wrote for the original dataset will have difficulty looping through such a large dataset, so I will refactor it in order to make my VBA script run faster and more efficiently.
